# TitanicDataAnalysis
This is an analysis of data regarding the passengers on the Titanic using Python and the pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, cufflinks, and scikit-learn libraries. I explore the data, create a number of visualizations, and create a logistic regression model which aims to predict which passengers survive.

Interactive graphs created using cufflinks currently do not seem to appear on the github page the jupter notebook is shown on.
